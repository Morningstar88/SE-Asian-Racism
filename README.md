## List of racist, xenophobic or small-minded comments I have heard in my time here.

Firstly I really feel for the poster.. I am not justifying the response at all !!

But as a westerner you get so aggressively hassled on Bali so much the assumption that some hustle was coming was likely thier default no response. Sad because it deprived them of a local interaction where someone DIDNT want something from them, the exact one you hope they would want.

Man yeah it sucks, but when you’re white and you travel anywhere in SEA you get scammed or attempted scamming all day every day it’s pretty fucked. You can’t go out and start a conversation or even friendships with locals because you aren’t certain you’re not being scammed or socially engineered in someway to their advantage.
