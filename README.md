## List of racist, xenophobic or small-minded comments I have heard in my time here.

Firstly I really feel for the poster.. I am not justifying the response at all !!

But as a westerner you get so aggressively hassled on Bali so much the assumption that some hustle was coming was likely thier default no response. Sad because it deprived them of a local interaction where someone DIDNT want something from them, the exact one you hope they would want.

Man yeah it sucks, but when you’re white and you travel anywhere in SEA you get scammed or attempted scamming all day every day it’s pretty fucked. You can’t go out and start a conversation or even friendships with locals because you aren’t certain you’re not being scammed or socially engineered in someway to their advantage.

It is tough. I totally understand how horrible that must have felt; and it was a racist reaction, but at the same time, ‘tourist’ Bali can be exhausting. My biggest annoyance was when crossing the road. Often, crossing roads is a stressful experience if you’re not used to the relaxed nature of traffic in Asia. When a gap in the traffic finally opened up, I’d be preparing myself to nip across the road and then the last vehicle would slow down and stop, blocking the road in front of me. The driver would look at me and say (without any real expectation), “taksi?”
