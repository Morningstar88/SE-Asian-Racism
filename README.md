## List of racist, xenophobic or small-minded comments I have heard in my time here.

Firstly I really feel for the poster.. I am not justifying the response at all !!

But as a westerner you get so aggressively hassled on Bali so much the assumption that some hustle was coming was likely thier default no response. Sad because it deprived them of a local interaction where someone DIDNT want something from them, the exact one you hope they would want.

Man yeah it sucks, but when you’re white and you travel anywhere in SEA you get scammed or attempted scamming all day every day it’s pretty fucked. You can’t go out and start a conversation or even friendships with locals because you aren’t certain you’re not being scammed or socially engineered in someway to their advantage.

It is tough. I totally understand how horrible that must have felt; and it was a racist reaction, but at the same time, ‘tourist’ Bali can be exhausting. My biggest annoyance was when crossing the road. Often, crossing roads is a stressful experience if you’re not used to the relaxed nature of traffic in Asia. When a gap in the traffic finally opened up, I’d be preparing myself to nip across the road and then the last vehicle would slow down and stop, blocking the road in front of me. The driver would look at me and say (without any real expectation), “taksi?”

What are your thoughts on Ni Luh Putu? The online influencer. To me, she's an opportunistic xenophobe. Weaponising bule misconduct to further her political ambitions. Social cohesion be damned.

White guy. It happened at a few of the temples. Besakih was the worst. I actually had three guys surround me and tell me I had to pay them each to enter the temple. I refused and left. I reported it to one of the leaders at another temple. He said there have been issues there for awhile, and it was giving visitors a terrible experience that would hurt Bali's reputation long term. Not sure if anything was ever done about it.

Canggu just isn’t for you. An example of this is Atlas Beach Fest and Finns Beach Club. The former is always filled with wealthy Indonesians (likely Jakartans as locals generally don’t have beach club money) and they all look bored as fuck, as if someone on instagram told them this is what you do to be cool. Finn’s on the other hand is always full of westerners who are GENUINELY having a good time, drinking and dancing and not on their phones looking bored. If you know you know.

what make things worse is canggu area controlled by mafia from certain country. these people think they are above the law...............until they have problem with the law especially with the immigration. lol

As an Aussie, while I try to be kind to everyone throughout my trip sometimes I feel like I’ve had enough people try to start a chat with me only for it to turn into a sales pitch for one day and might become a bit stand-offish.
